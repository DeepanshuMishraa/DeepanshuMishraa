### 🧠 Experience

**Director of Existential Semantics**  
Defined undefined behavior until it felt something. Spearheaded multiple initiatives to render purpose optional.

**Senior Vice Coordinator of Recursive Indecision**  
Established a system where decisions are made only after being unmade. Scaled confusion with confidence.

**Head of Nothing in Particular**  
Successfully managed the absence of responsibility while optimizing meetings that could've been dreams.

### 📖 Currently Learning

- Industrial confusion & tactical inconvenience
- Analytical analysis (very meta, very circular)
- Cubic regression as an emotional journey
- Verose abstraction (just the vague kind)
- Rats — behavior, philosophy, and urban navigation
- Force push and accept fate
